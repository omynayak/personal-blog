        <p>Hello there, (hopefully)friendly passerby!</p>
        <p>
          This is Om's Home (very cliche choice of a name, I know, maybe I'll
          change it sometime soon), and this is all about me as a person, or
          maybe a vague abstract concept of a being if that thought makes you
          more comfortable!
        </p>
        <h3 class="side-heading">Man, who even are you?</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Om. I like building stuff. I also like dogs and cats. I
          have 8 dogs of my own. I also love the ocean. You can make your way to
          the gallery now if you understood all of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no, seriously, my name is Om and I am an aspiring engineer (also
          called an engineering student) in a little college in India. I am
          about 20 years old and I like spending most of my time chasing novelty
          in the form of ideas and just things to learn in general. When I'm not
          at my desk, working on something that I think is nifty, you'll
          probably find me in the garden admiring the flowers, or maybe I'm in
          the living room watching TV, and if all else fails you'll find me
          either sleeping or reading some old book.

          I recently discovered the amazing world of web development, which to a
          low level systems and embedded programmer like me, who barely sees any
          code that doesn't refer to strings as char* , is like sorcery and a
          butt load of fun. That's why like every other mistake made in the
          history of humanity, I decided to tell myself "meh, how hard could it
          be" and dove head first into
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >The Odin Project</a
          >, which is a really cool and arguably the best place for anybody to
          learn web development from.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I navigated through the dense and thick jungle that is web
          development, I found myself increasingly enamored by the idea of
          making a website for myself, someplace I could show off all the cool
          stuff I run into on the daily, someplace I can talk about the things
          I've built and my own thoughts behind it. Basically any reason to not
          constantly blow up my friends' phones with 100 notifications and to
          hopefully make some new friends too!
