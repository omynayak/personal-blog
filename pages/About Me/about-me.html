        <p>Hello there, (hopefully) friendly passerby!</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to Om's Home—yeah, I know, kind of a cliché name, but it works
          for now. This is my corner of the internet where I share bits of who I
          am—or maybe just a vague, abstract concept of a being, if that’s more
          your vibe.
        </p></div>
        <div class="container">
          <h3 class="side-heading">Man, who even are you?</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Om. I like building things. I also love dogs (I have
            eight!) and cats, and I’ve always been drawn to the ocean. If that
            resonates with you, feel free to head over to the gallery.
          </p>

            More seriously, I’m a 20-year-old engineering student at a small
            college in India. I spend most of my time chasing novelty—whether
            it's through new ideas, obscure topics, or just interesting stuff to
            learn. When I’m not tinkering at my desk, you’ll probably find me in
            the garden admiring the flowers, lounging with a book, or watching
            something in the living room.

            Recently, I stumbled into the world of web development. For someone
            who mostly writes low-level systems code and still thinks of strings
            as <code>char*</code>, it felt like sorcery—and a ton of fun. So
            like every overconfident nerd before me, I said, “Meh, how hard
            could it be?” and dove headfirst into
            <a
              href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >The Odin Project</a
            >, an incredibly cool (and arguably the best) place to start
            learning web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I hacked my way through the dense jungle of web dev, I got
            excited by the idea of making a site for myself—a place to show off
            the nifty things I build, share thoughts, and document random cool
            discoveries. Basically, it’s a way to stop spamming my friends with
            a hundred texts a day—and maybe even make some new ones along the
            way!
